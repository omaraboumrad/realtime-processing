# Django Realtime Processing

Purpose is to demonstrate how to process images in the background and get realtime updates via websockets.

Prototype with Django 6.0 Alpha 1, Django Tasks and Django Channels.

# How to run

You can run via uv

```
$ uv sync
$ uv python manage.py migrate
$ uv python manage.py runserver
```

or via a virtual environment

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate 
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
(venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```

Then just navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser

# How to use

- Select an image to upload
- A record will be created instantly for that image
- Click on "Source" to see the image
- Click on "Process" to process the image
- Watch the logs in the right panel
- When the processing is done, the list item will be updated.
- Click on "Result" to view the processing result

The Ping/Pong interaction is there to demonstrate how the websocket is not blocked while the image upload/processing is happening.
